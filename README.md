## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model of CodeMastermindHQ:

1. Requirements Analysis:
   - Purpose: The purpose of the [CodeMastermindHQ](https://codemastermindhq.netlify.app/) project is to provide a platform for learning and practicing coding skills.
   - Objectives: The primary objectives of the project are to offer [coding challenges](https://codemastermindhq.netlify.app/support/), provide [educational resources](https://codemastermindhq.netlify.app/courses), and [foster a community for programmers](https://codemastermindhq.netlify.app/showcase).
   - Stakeholders: The main stakeholders include developers, coding enthusiasts, educators, and learners.
   - Requirements:
     - Functional Requirements: 
       - User registration and authentication system
       - Coding challenges with varying difficulty levels
       - Educational resources such as tutorials, articles, and videos
       - User profile management
       - Community features like forums or chat
     - Non-functional Requirements:
       - Responsive design for seamless user experience across devices
       - High performance and scalability to handle a large user base
       - Secure data storage and transmission
       - Intuitive and user-friendly interface

2. Design:
   - Architecture: The [CodeMastermindHQ](https://codemastermindhq.netlify.app/) project follows a client-server architecture, with a web-based front-end and a backend API.
   - Components:
     - Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React for building the user interface.
     - Back-end: Node.js and Express for creating the API, along with a database management system like MongoDB.
   - User Interface: The user interface will be designed to be intuitive, visually appealing, and responsive to different screen sizes.
   - Design Tools: Tools like Figma or Sketch will be used to create wireframes and mockups for the user interface.
   - I used [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) for [CodeMastermindHQ](https://codemastermindhq.netlify.app/).

3. Implementation/Coding:
   - Development Environment: Developers will use IDEs or text editors ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) of their choice along with version control systems like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/).
   - Coding Conventions: Consistent coding conventions will be followed for code readability and maintainability.
   - Technology Stack:
     - Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, and any additional libraries or frameworks as needed.
     - Back-end: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and any necessary middleware or libraries.
   - Code Organization: The code will be organized into modules or components for better maintainability and reusability.

4. Testing:
   - Testing Approach: The project will follow a comprehensive testing strategy that includes [unit testing](https://github.com/CodeMastermindHQ/CodeMastermindHQ/blob/main/src/utils/__tests__/jsUtils.test.ts), [integration testing](https://github.com/CodeMastermindHQ/CodeMastermindHQ/tree/main/src/utils), and [user acceptance testing (UAT)](https://github.com/CodeMastermindHQ/CodeMastermindHQ/tree/main/src/utils).
   - Tools and Frameworks: Testing frameworks like [Jest](https://github.com/CodeMastermindHQ/CodeMastermindHQ/tree/main/src/utils) or Mocha will be used for unit and integration testing. UAT will involve real users testing the application.
   - Test Cases: Test cases will be created to cover different scenarios, including positive and negative test cases for each feature.

5. Deployment:
   - Hosting Platform: The project will be hosted on a platform [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which provides easy deployment and scalability.
   - Deployment Process:
     - Set up the hosting environment on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
     - Configure any necessary environment variables.
     - Automate the build and deployment process using [CI/CD tools](https://github.com/CodeMastermindHQ/CodeMastermindHQ/pull/22#issuecomment-1620943708).
     - Monitor the deployment for any errors or issues.

6. Maintenance and Support:
   - Bug Tracking: Use an issue tracking system like [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CodeMastermindHQ/CodeMastermindHQ/issues/new) to track and address reported bugs or feature requests.
   - Updates and Enhancements: Regularly update dependencies, frameworks, and libraries to ensure security and compatibility. Continuously enhance the site based on user feedback.
   - Support Channels: Provide a support email or a contact form for users to reach out with any issues or inquiries.
   - Monitoring and Maintenance: Monitor site performance, uptime, and user feedback. Perform regular backups and security updates to ensure the stability and reliability of the site.
