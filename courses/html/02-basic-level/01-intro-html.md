## What is HTML?
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages. It provides a way to describe the structure and content of a webpage using tags and elements. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers to display the webpage to users.

HTML was first introduced by **Tim Berners-Lee** in 1990 as a way to share scientific information on the internet

### HTML Structure and Syntax
HTML documents follow a specific structure and syntax:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

<BrowserWindow>
      
      <body>
          <h1>Heading 1</h1>
          <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
      </body>
      
 </BrowserWindow>

:::tip Code Explaination:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used (HTML5 in this case).
- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML document. It contains the entire content of the webpage.
- `<head>`: This element represents the head section of the HTML document. It contains meta information, title, and linked CSS or JavaScript files.
- `<title>`: The title of the webpage that appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>`: The body section of the HTML document. It contains the visible content of the webpage, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.

## Setting up an HTML Document
To create an HTML document, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code).
2. Start with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to specify the HTML version.
3. Add the `<html>` element as the root element.
4. Inside the `<html>` element, add the `<head>` and `<body>` elements.
5. Within the `<head>` element, include the `<title>` element to specify the webpage's title.
6. Within the `<body>` element, add the desired content using HTML tags and elements.

## Viewing an HTML File in a Web Browser
To view an HTML file in a web browser, follow these steps:

1. Save the HTML file with the .html extension (e.g., index.html).
2. Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3. In the browser, go to the File menu and choose "Open File" or use the keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+O).
4. Browse and select the HTML file you want to view.
5. Click "Open" or press Enter.
6. The web browser will render and display the HTML content, showing the webpage as intended.

By following these steps, you can create an HTML file and view it in a web browser to see how the tags and elements are interpreted and displayed.

Here's an example of the basic structure of an HTML document:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is the content of my web page.</p>
    <img src="https://ajay-dhangar.github.io/portfolio/Assets/img/author.jpg" alt="My Image" width="100px" border="1px"> <br /><br />
    <a href="https://ajay-dhangar.github.io/portfolio/">Click here</a> to visit a website.
  </body>
</html>
```

 <BrowserWindow>
      
          <body>
            <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
            <p>This is the content of my web page.</p>
            <img src="https://ajay-dhangar.github.io/portfolio/Assets/img/author.jpg" alt="My Image" width="100px" border="1px" /> <br /><br />
            <a href="https://ajay-dhangar.github.io/portfolio/">Click here</a> to visit a website.
          </body>

</BrowserWindow>

## Basic HTML Tags: `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`

- `<html>`: The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML document. It wraps all the other elements on the page and serves as the starting point for every HTML document.

- `<head>`: The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the document title, character encoding, linked stylesheets, and scripts. It does not display any content directly on the page.

- `<body>`: The `<body>` element represents the main content of the web page. It contains all the visible elements that are displayed in the browser window, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

These tags work together to structure and define the content of an HTML document. The `<html>` tag encapsulates the entire document, the `<head>` tag provides metadata, and the `<body>` tag holds the visible content.

Understanding the basic structure and tags of an HTML document is essential before diving deeper into building web pages and applications.
